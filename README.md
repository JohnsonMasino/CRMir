# Project Title:SMSir (SMS Gateway System with Flutter and Django)

## Overview:
The SMS Gateway System is a comprehensive communication solution that leverages Flutter as the Android front-end framework and Django as the back-end framework. This project aims to provide users with a seamless and intuitive interface for composing, sending, and monitoring SMS messages. The integration of the Flutter and Django technologies allows for a robust and scalable architecture, ensuring reliable SMS delivery and efficient management of user interactions.

## Desciption
A revolutionary messaging solution that leverages the power of WebSockets to provide lightning-fast and reliable text message delivery.

## Key Features:
**User-friendly Interface:**
The Flutter-based Android application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to effortlessly compose and send SMS messages.

**Authentication and Security:**
User registration and authentication mechanisms ensure secure access to the SMS gateway system, protecting sensitive user information.

**SMS Composition and Sending:**
Users can compose SMS messages within the Flutter app and send them to the Django back end for further processing.

**Backend Processing with Django:**
Django serves as the back-end framework, handling incoming SMS requests, validating user credentials, and interfacing with SMS gateway providers (e.g., Twilio, Nexmo) to send SMS messages.

**SMS History and Status Tracking:**
The system maintains a comprehensive history of sent SMS messages, including details such as sender, recipient, timestamp, and delivery status.

**Real-time Updates:**
Users receive real-time updates on the status of sent SMS messages, enabling them to track the progress and outcome of their communications.

## Technology Stack:
**Front-end:**
Flutter for Android application development.

**Back-end:**
Django for server-side processing and interaction with SMS gateway providers.

**Database:**
Utilizes a database system compatible with Django(sqlite3) for data storage.

## Interaction between Front-end and Back-end

**User initiates SMS:**
User composes SMS on the Flutter app and sends it to the Django back end.

**Django processes SMS request:**
Django validates the request, checks user authentication, and processes the SMS.

**SMS sent via Gateway:**
Django interacts with the SMS gateway provider to send the SMS.

**Update Front-end:**
Update the Flutter app with the status of the sent SMS

## Project Benefits
